# Low-level Nightmare

**Author**: Shine Chang

## Setup
The Pioneer Robotics team is testing out a new color sensor for use in their autonomous program. 
Their software team wrote a short program to test out the sensor, but for some reason, the robot just keeps crashing.
After stripping the code down as much as possible, they were left with the attached program, but still couldn't figure out why.
Taisei says he knows why, but he won't help but instead keeps saying "you should've used Rust!"

## Statement
The error in the code snippet is the flag. 
**Clarification:** There are many ways to describe one error, so even though you may know the error, it may still not be clear what exactly the "flag" should be. However, if you do have the right error, just try key phrases or words that relate to that error. Hint: it's one word.
**NOTE:** There will still be the `flag{}` prefix & suffix. Put the what you think is the flag inside the brackets.
