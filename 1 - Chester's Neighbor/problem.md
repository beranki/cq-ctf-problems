# Chester's Neighbor 

**Author**: Asteya Laxmanan 

## Setup
Once upon a time, in a quaint little village nestled between rolling hills and whispering forests, there lived a peculiar fellow named Chester. Chester was known throughout the village for his eccentricities and love for all things cryptic.

One day, Chester decided it was time for a change. He packed his belongings and bid farewell to his cozy cottage on Oakwood Lane. With a skip in his step and a twinkle in his eye, Chester set off for a new adventure, moving to another house down the street, precisely 3 houses down, to where his old friend Caesar used to live. Now, new owners have occupied Chester's old home.

As he settled into his new abode, Chester stumbled upon an old journal hidden away in the attic. The journal, weathered and dusty from years of neglect, seemed to beckon to him, promising untold secrets and hidden treasures.

On the first page of the journal, he found, in exquisite writing, the following:


'Ilqg hffhqwulwlhv.waw lq wkh uhsr'


Later on, Chester gets an envelope in his mailbox. It reads:
'"NEVER GONNA NEVer NEVER LET NEVER TURN + GOnna You AROUND GIVE AND GOnna AROUND" 
  has bought your house'
