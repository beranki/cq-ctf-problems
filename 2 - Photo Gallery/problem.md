# Photo Gallery

**Author**: Alvin Kang

## Setup
After exactly an hour of uninterrupted internet access, Bhargav learns that his beloved photo gallery website has been a victim of a cyber attack. After careful review, he confirms that there were no indicators of significant compromises within his system, but was left with a strange image. Bhargav outsources the work of identifying the hacker, wanting to ensure that they are punished. Here shares the photo that the attacker left on his website, which you can view [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Old-Respect-9735/CyberQuest_v2/master/public/image424.svg).


## Statement
Use the image to find the following...

A: What is the username of the attacker?

B: Many people go by aliases on the internet, but some become so attached to them that they use them across multiple different platforms. Let’s assume that the attacker is obsessed with their username, particularly for their GitHub account. What key does the attacker use as a result of his tragic short term memory?

C: What is the attacker’s favorite movie? Make sure to type the movie word for word (capitalization matters) (This is very important to the investigation and not a distraction…).
